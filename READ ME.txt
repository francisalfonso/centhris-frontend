You are building the Employee List page of CentHRIS.
You must fetch paginated data from:

GET /api/employees?search=&amp;page=1&amp;per_page=10

Requirements:
Create a Pinia store called useEmployeeStore.

Implement:
getEmployees(search, page)

Implement automatic retry when the API fails (max 3 attempts with delay).

Expected Output:
A working store in TypeScript, clean and readable.
